# What is this website?
1. This website was created using React and both a database that I built (a Mock API) and a third party API (themoviedb.org). The purpose of the website is to be an open source application that displays general movie info and images. It displays a widget at the top of the home directory that displays the most popular movie at the moment based on a popularity data point, and the average user rating. It also implements React Router which is used to link to a different page where you can create your own personal movie card.


# What Struggles did I face?
1. Using state and router was a struggle. There were some struggles with pulling data from the widget as I could not access the photo of the movies conventionally. What I did to fix the issue was use a terniary operator that replaced the base_url of the image.

# What did I get out of this project? 
1. This project really solidifed my fundamentals with react. My understanding of state and lifting state is much better than before. I am confident that I can build an application that pulls data from a third party api successfully. I also feel like I learned a lot about organizing my components and using react router correctly.
